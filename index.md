<h3>Mode of the DL journal and discussion club</h3>

<ul>
	<li/>  The focus is on the interactive discussion of publication, blogs or topics around Deep Learning, probabilistic prediction models, and causality (or other topics of general interest). During corona-crisis we meet via zoom or MS teams.  
	<li/>  All kind of **stupid questions are very welcome and even necessary** to learn as much as possible. We aim to discuss as well details, like mathematical and technical aspects, as high level implications of the paper. 
	<li/>  The only rule is that \bf{we all read the paper before meeting}. 
	<li/> One person suggests the topic and starts the discussion with a short summary (~5min) and then leads the discussion. 
	   <li/>The discussion leader provides links to the material/article one week before the meeting and write an e-mail to all listed participants. The role of the discussion leader is in each meeting taken by somebody else (see linked spreadsheet below)
  <li/>If you want to participate, please put your name in the linked spreadsheet below:

Ideally, the topics is not too complicated, so that we all can manage to read through the suggested material (otherwise it suites better for a <a href="https://tensorchiefs.github.io/bbs/">bbs</a> which is also good).

Feel free to extent the list by dates or change the dates and put-in your name with “tba” topics and decide spontanously on the topic. Ideally, the discussion leader sends out an e-mail ~1 week before the meeting (e-mails are in the google docs list above). 
 
It is clear that not all can make it every time but the event lives from our active participation. In case of any question please feel free to contact me (sick@zhaw.ch).
