<h3>Mode of the DL journal and discussion club</h3>

<ul>
	<li/> We all participate active in the sessions and (roughly) read the article or other material that should be discussed before
  <li/> We do not envision a talk with slides but want discuss together the article/topic
	<li/> The discussio leader does not need to be an expert! 
	<li/> Discussions and all kind of questions (also stupid ones) are welcome - its actually the reason to meet!!
  <li/>Everybody who wants to participate must also present once 
	<li/> The room will be announced via e-mail and will be on the SoE campus 
	<li/> You might bring your lunch with you
</ul>

Ideally, the topics is connected to DL and are not too complicated, so that we all can read through the material beforehand.
You can also put in your name with “tba” topics and decide shortly before the data on the topic you want to discuss, but at latest one week before the meeting the topic with some material links or info should be announced. 
You can join the club by putting your name and a topic in the list above. If Wednesday is not possible four you please suggest another day over lunch (or later afternoon). In case of any question please feel free to contact me (sick@zhaw.ch).
