<h3>DL journal and discussion club</h3>

<ul>
	<li/> We all participate active in the sessions and (roughly) read the article or other material that should be discussed before
  <li/> We do not envision a talk with slides but want discuss together the article/topic
	<li/> The discussio leader does not need to be an expert! 
	<li/> Discussions and all kind of questions (also stupid ones) are welcome - its actually the reason to meet!!
  <li/>Everybody who wants to participate must also present once 
	<li/> The room will be announced via e-mail and will be on the SoE campus 
	<li/> You might bring your lunch with you
</ul>
<br>
<em> 
Active contributions are required!  Please add your chosen paper or topic of interest together with a date in the following
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nvDV3tVnD2YjbOf81les5Ef9hwEc7_PrcLruXVaHXJg/edit?usp=sharing">Topic_dates_list</a>
  <li/>Ideally, the topics connect to DL and are not too complicated, so that we all can read through the material before hand.
  <li/>You can also put in your name with “tba” topics and decide shortly before the data on the topic you want to discuss. 
<li/>	The topic with some links or info should be at latest announced one week before the meeting. 
  <li/>If Wednesday is not possible four you please suggest another day over lunch (or later afternoon).
  <li/>You can join the club by putting your name and a topic in the list above.
  In case of any question please feel free to contact me (sick@zhaw.ch) if
