<h3>Mode of the DL journal and discussion club</h3>

<ul>
	<li/> We all participate active in the sessions and beforehand (roughly) check out the material
  <li/> We do not envision a talk with slides but want to discuss together the article/topic
	<li/> The discussion leader does not need to be an expert! 
	<li/> Discussions and all kind of questions (also stupid ones) are welcome - its actually the reason to meet!!
  <li/>Everybody who wants to participate must also present once 
	<li/> You might bring your lunch with you
</ul>

Ideally, the topics is connected to DL and are not too complicated, so that we all can read through the material beforehand.
You can also put in your name with “tba” topics and decide shortly before the data on the topic you want to discuss, but at latest one week before the meeting the topic with some material links or info should be announced. 
You can join the club by putting your name and a topic in the list above. If Wednesday is not possible four you please suggest another day over lunch (or later afternoon) - you can organize a room and put it in the table, or I will do it for you. Every discussion leader is asked to send out an e-mail ~1 week before the meeting (e-mails are in the list above). In case of any question please feel free to contact me (sick@zhaw.ch).
